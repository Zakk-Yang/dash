    "In the past Plotly had offline and online modes. When in online mode, all the graphs you created would be saved in your Plotly account online. But there was a limit of graphs you could create for free, so you either had to constantly delete your graphs from your account or pay. The alternative was to switch to offline mode, so that your graphs were only displayed in your Jupyter Notebook and are not saved online. \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from Plotly version 4.0 released in July 2019, the offline mode is used by default, and the online functionality is moved to a separate package called `chart-studio` (more on Plotly version 4.0 [here](https://medium.com/plotly/plotly-py-4-0-is-here-offline-only-express-first-displayable-anywhere-fc444e5659ee)). So make sure you are using tha latest version of Plotly and in this case you don't need to specify that you want to use offline mode explicitly."

    "\n",
    "Meat consumption is related to living standards, diet, livestock production and consumer prices, as well as macroeconomic uncertainty and shocks to GDP. Compared to other commodities, meat is characterised by high production costs and high output prices. Meat demand is associated with higher incomes and a shift - due to urbanisation - to food consumption changes that favour increased proteins from animal sources in diets. While the global meat industry provides food and a livelihood for billions of people, it also has significant environmental and health consequences for the planet. This indicator is presented for beef and veal, pig, poultry, and sheep. Meat consumption is measured in thousand tonnes of carcass weight (except for poultry expressed as ready to cook weight) and in kilograms of retail weight per capita. Carcass weight to retail weight conversion factors are: 0.7 for beef and veal, 0.78 for pigmeat, and 0.88 for both sheep meat and poultry meat.\n",
